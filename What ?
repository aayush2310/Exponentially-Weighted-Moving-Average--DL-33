EWMA is a technique using which we find trends/pattern in a time series based data.
Used in time-series forcasting,company's financial forcasting,signal processing,building cool optimizers in DL

while calculating EWMA,we value the points which have come recently in the past more than the older points.
as time will pass,the weightage of the point will get reduced.

Impact of beta:-
we assume that we are calculating average of the last 1/(1-beta)  days.

The more we take the value of beta,the more we are giving value to our old points and vice-versa.
The less beta-more value to current point-what happened today is affecting more this guy-he is moody-spikey graph observed
 
beta generally taken as 0.9

alpha=1-beta
